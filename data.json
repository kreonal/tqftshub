Tyreek Hill was all over the field, leaving defenders grasping at air, and Stefon Diggs showed why he’s still a top-tier receiver. With a win under their belt, this team is looking ripe for a deep run. The only question is, can anyone stop them before they slip away with the title?"

If Reed keeps this up, Nick’s team is going to be the one everyone’s “reeding” about all season. This squad looks sharp, and Week 1 was just the beginning."

With a roster rank of 6, he's got the depth to stay dangerous, but the question is: Can Mr. Make A Play keep making plays, or will this train hit a wall? Stay tuned."

A score of 105.11 points is nothing to sneeze at, but when you’ve got a roster ranked 5th, the expectation is to be handing out the beatings, not taking them. If this team can wake up from its Week 1 nap, the rest of the league better stay on high alert."
